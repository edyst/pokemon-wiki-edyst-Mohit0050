                    <p style="text-align: center;margin-left: 200px;margin-right: 200px;">Pokémon is a series of video
                        games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the
                        Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first
                        games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing video
                        games (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their developers</p>

                            <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which
                                constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type
                                concept easily to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon,
                                which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.</p>

                                constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type
                                concept easily to new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of
                                the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.</p>

                            <p>The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process
                                of getting out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight
                                almost in spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that
                                he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.</p>

                                <li> We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic
                                    knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well
                                    versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even
                                    stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe
                                    you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all
                                    Pokemon trainers should be able to answer. </li>

                                <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey
                                    off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some
                                    of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way
                                    through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the
                                    most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button
                                    mashing at all is required.
